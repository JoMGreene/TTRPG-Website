Many do not support the current research into manatech, citing the ruins of the past civilization as evidence for the consequences of what happens when magic strays too far from its natural state. However, not all Arbel share this philosophy. In Silvitar, the nation founded by Vitarbris’s guardians and homeland to most Arbel, a minority group in support of magitech advancement is beginning to gain traction."],

Their legs end in large hooves rather than feet.", "h1Culture:", "The Hanlar mainly inhabit the Isle of Jagoy, but many are also found in the northern coastal Kingdoms. In ages past, the Hanlar were a tribalistic race, feared throughout the Kingdoms for their battle prowess and fierce raids. In more recent times, many of the Hanlar tribes have discovered that trade is just as effective a means of earning money as raiding, and have joined together to form the Skulari Coalition. While one of the youngest Kingdoms, the Coalition has quickly become an economic powerhouse. The few tribes that have not joined the alliance continue to raid villages along the northern and eastern coasts of Noxtellus, but their presence is minor."],

They stand alongside the Hanlar as the largest of the 5 species, and their draconic features are evocative of the terror inspired when seeing a true dragon. The large reptilian wings on their backs are more than capable of propelling them through the air at incredible speeds. Their hands and feet, covered in rough scaly skin, end in deadly claws.", "h1Culture:", "The Volarco are somewhat of a rare sight outside of their homeland of Draesroth. Despite their large stature and intimidating appearance, most Volarco tend to avoid conflict wherever possible. Many of the recent advancements in manatech are due to the contributions of Volarco researchers. Due to both the technological capabilities and the imposing physical stature of the Volarco, the Kingdoms that neighbor Draesroth have long worried of potential invasions by the draconic inventors. However, the Volarco themselves have never given any indication of an intent to expand their territory. In truth, the Volarco enjoy the solitary lands of Draesroth. The mountains that enclose their land are full of ruins and caves that provide the materials necessary for their manatech research, and the central plains contain ample land for cities and agriculture to thrive."],
