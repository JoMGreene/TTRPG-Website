World magic is defined by its use of mana to directly influence the world. Though its form may differ based on the specific type of World magic being used, World spells are applications of mana outside of the body that create or otherwise influence objects. When a World spell is cast, mana is channeled from the mana heart out of the body, typically through the palms of the caster’s hands. As the mana exits the body, the caster changes its form and directs it as necessary for the particular spell they are using.", "In the same way that the Trees of World magic are distinct from one another, so too are the people who most commonly practice each of the trees. Forces magic is favored by scholars and nobility. Elementalism is " , "Because World magic is more a manifestation of ideas and beliefs than an influence on the caster’s own body, World mages often find the best way to improve their magic power is by attuning themselves to the particular type of mindset required for their field of World magic."],

Restoration magic enhances the natural healing and growth of other creatures, useful for healing allies or comtrolling magical flora.

Mana is expended to enhance the abilities of individual body parts at each step of the technique as necessary. When properly executed, the series of minor enhancements comes together, creating a complete technique. Blitz Maneuvers are commonly thought of by their users as being akin to songs; each note in a song is a rather simple sound, but when combined and executed properly they can create brilliant experiences. Blitz Maneuvers, due to their precise and intricate movements, often require certain types of weapons to perform, take a Primary Action and a variable amount of Secondary Actions to use, or have other individual requirements.

Weapon requirements can list required weapon number(1 or 2 typically), properties(Bladed, Blunt, Shield, Unarmed, etc), and handedness(Two-Handed, One-Handed, Dual, etc). As the techniques are so precise, Blitz ranges for melee attacks are stricter than normal ranges. A melee Blitz can only be performed at the ranges listed in its type entry. A Blitz with a listed range of 2, for example, can not be performed at ranges 0 or 1, only at range 2 specifically. For Blitz Maneuvers with ranged or thrown weapons, they will sometimes list a specific range that works as it does for a melee Blitz, or will list the range as ‘Weapon’. A Blitz with a range of Weapon can be performed at any valid range for the weapon used to make the Blitz, and applies any bonuses or penalties due to range as normal.", "For an example of a complete Blitz entry, Whirling Slash has its type listed as ‘Blitz (Dual Bladed, 1, 0-1)’.
