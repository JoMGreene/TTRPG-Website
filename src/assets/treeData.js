People dressed in robes and oversized hats shooting fireballs and missiles of force towards each other while flying through the air. A priest praying to their god, creating a divine shield to protect their allies. An indistinct figure melting into darkness then launching out of a nearby shadow, catching their victim unawares. A healer holding their hands over an ally’s wounds, rapidly knitting flesh back together.", "All of these descriptions fall under the umbrella of World magic. World magic is defined by its use of mana to directly influence the world. Though its form may differ based on the specific type of World magic being used, World spells are applications of mana outside of the body that create or otherwise influence objects. When a World spell is cast, mana is channeled from the mana heart out of the body, typically through the palms of the caster’s hands. As the mana exits the body, the caster changes its form and directs it as necessary for the particular spell they are using.", "In the same way that the Trees of World magic are distinct from one another, so too are the people who most commonly practice each of the trees. Forces magic is favored by scholars and nobility. Elementalism is " , "Because World magic is more a manifestation of ideas and beliefs than an influence on the caster’s own body, World mages often find the best way to improve their magic power is by attuning themselves to the particular type of mindset required for their field of World magic."],
